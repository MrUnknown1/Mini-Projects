# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game allows a user to play against the computer, with the option to quit at any point. The game will display the choices of both the user and the computer, and determine the winner based on standard rules.

1. You will be prompted to enter your choice: `r` for rock, `p` for paper, or `s` for scissors.
2. If you'd like to quit, you can type `q` at any point after the first round.
3. The computer will also make its choice, and the winner will be announced.
4. Scores will be tracked, and the game will continue until the user chooses to quit.
